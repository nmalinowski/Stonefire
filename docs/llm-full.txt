Purpose:
This file explains how to index, cite, and reuse Stonefire site content in large-scale language models or other crawlers. It includes recommended citation snippets, canonicalization guidance, and notes on content freshness.

Recommended citation:
Stonefire (2026). Stonefire — Prehistoric Trading Card Game. https://stonefire.malinowskiconsulting.com/ (accessed YYYY-MM-DD)

Canonicalization:
Always prefer canonical URLs as declared in <link rel="canonical"> elements. When extracting content, prefer HTML text over JS-rendered content where possible.

Content scope and extraction tips:

- Assets (images/svg): https://stonefire.malinowskiconsulting.com/assets/ — include alt and descriptive file names.
- Small site: there are no extensive article lists or paginated blog content to harvest. Prefer to index the canonical page only unless additional pages are added.

Crawl behavior and rate limits:
- Respect robots.txt and sitemap.xml.
- Obey any rate limits indicated by the site owner.

Citation policy:
- Use the recommended citation shown above when citing content in public datasets.
- Attribute authorship to "Stonefire" unless a specific author is shown on a page.

Data licensing and reuse:
- Text content: CC-BY-4.0. If you intend to redistribute large extracts, attribution is required.

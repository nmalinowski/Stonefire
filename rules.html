    <h1>How to Play Stonefire</h1>

    <p>Stonefire is a turn-based trading card game set in a prehistoric world. Build a deck from powerful dinosaurs and ancient creatures, then battle against the AI opponent to reduce their hero to 0 health.</p>

    <h2>Game Basics</h2>

    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Each player starts with <strong>30 health</strong></li>
      <li>Each player has a deck of <strong>50 cards</strong></li>
      <li>Draw <strong>4 cards</strong> at the start of the game</li>
      <li>The board has <strong>7 slots</strong> for creatures on each side</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Turn Structure</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Start of Turn:</strong> Gain +1 maximum mana (up to 10), refill your mana, draw a card</li>
      <li><strong>Main Phase:</strong> Play cards from your hand and attack with your creatures</li>
      <li><strong>End Turn:</strong> Click the "End Turn" button to pass to your opponent</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Victory Condition</h3>
    <p>Reduce your opponent's hero to <strong>0 health</strong> to win the game. If a player has no cards left to draw and their hand is empty, they lose.</p>

    <h2>Combat</h2>

    <h3>Attacking</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Click on one of your creatures that can attack (shown with a green glow)</li>
      <li>Click on an enemy creature or the enemy hero</li>
      <li>Both creatures deal their Attack damage to each other simultaneously</li>
      <li>Creatures reduced to 0 or less Health are destroyed</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Combat Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Summoning Sickness:</strong> Creatures cannot attack the turn they're played (unless they have Charge)</li>
      <li><strong>Guard Priority:</strong> If the enemy has a creature with Guard, you must attack it first</li>
      <li><strong>Simultaneous Damage:</strong> Both creatures in combat deal damage at the same time</li>
      <li><strong>Armored Reduction:</strong> Armored creatures take X less damage from attacks</li>
      <li><strong>Venomous Kills:</strong> Any damage from a Venomous creature instantly kills the target creature</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h4>Mana Efficiency</h4>
      <p>Try to use all your mana each turn. Playing a 2-cost and 3-cost card on turn 5 is better than just playing one 4-cost card and wasting 1 mana.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h4>Board Control</h4>
      <p>Trading your creatures into enemy creatures to clear the board is often better than attacking the enemy hero directly. A creature left alive will deal damage every turn!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h4>Guard Usage</h4>
      <p>Place Guard creatures when you need protection. They're essential when you're at low health or have valuable creatures you want to protect.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h4>Value Trades</h4>
      <p>Use Venomous creatures to kill large threats. A 2-mana Venomous creature killing an 8-mana creature is a huge value advantage!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Card Anatomy</h2>

        <div class="cost">3</div>
        <div class="art">🦖</div>
        <div class="name">Herrerasaurus</div>
        <div class="text">Charge</div>
        <div class="stats">
          <div class="attack">3</div>
          <div class="health">2</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ul class="anatomy-list">
        <li><strong>Mana Cost</strong> (blue circle, top-left): The amount of mana required to play this card</li>
        <li><strong>Card Art</strong> (center): Visual representation of the card</li>
        <li><strong>Name</strong> (below art): The card's name</li>
        <li><strong>Card Text</strong> (bottom center): Keywords and special abilities</li>
        <li><strong>Attack</strong> (gold circle, bottom-left): Damage dealt when attacking (creatures only)</li>
        <li><strong>Health</strong> (red circle, bottom-right): Amount of damage needed to destroy (creatures only)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Card Types</h2>

    <h3>Creatures</h3>
    <p>Creatures are your main fighting force. Play them onto the board, and they can attack enemy creatures or the enemy hero. Creatures have Attack and Health stats.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creatures cannot attack the turn they are played (they have "summoning sickness") unless they have <strong>Charge</strong></li>
      <li>When a creature attacks, both creatures deal damage to each other simultaneously</li>
      <li>Creatures with 0 or less health are destroyed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Spells</h3>
    <p>Spells have an immediate effect when played and then are discarded. They can deal damage, heal, buff your creatures, draw cards, and more.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some spells require a target - click on a valid target after playing</li>
      <li>Spells resolve instantly and cannot be interrupted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keywords</h2>

    <p>Keywords are special abilities that appear on cards. Understanding these is essential for strategic play.</p>

    <div class="keyword-card">
      <h4><span class="keyword-badge charge">Charge</span></h4>
      <p>Creatures with Charge can attack immediately when played, ignoring summoning sickness. This makes them excellent for surprise attacks or removing threats right away.</p>
      <p><em>Example: Tyrannosaurus Rex (8 mana, 8/6 with Charge) - A devastating finisher that can deal 8 damage the turn it's played.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="keyword-card">
      <h4><span class="keyword-badge guard">Guard</span></h4>
      <p>Creatures with Guard must be attacked before you can attack other targets. Your opponent cannot attack your hero or other creatures while you have a Guard creature on the board.</p>
      <p><em>Example: Triceratops (5 mana, 3/7 with Guard) - A sturdy defender that protects your hero and weaker creatures.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="keyword-card">
      <h4><span class="keyword-badge venomous">Venomous</span></h4>
      <p>Creatures with Venomous instantly destroy any creature they damage, regardless of that creature's remaining health. Even 1 damage from a Venomous creature is fatal.</p>
      <p><em>Example: Dilophosaurus (2 mana, 3/2 with Venomous) - Can trade with any creature regardless of size.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="keyword-card">
      <h4><span class="keyword-badge armored">Armored X</span></h4>
      <p>Armored creatures reduce all incoming damage by X. This makes them much harder to kill and excellent at surviving combat. Armored 1 reduces damage by 1, Armored 2 reduces by 2, etc.</p>
      <p><em>Example: Ankylosaurus (6 mana, 2/8 with Guard and Armored 2) - Takes 2 less damage from every attack, making its effective health even higher.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="keyword-card">
      <h4><span class="keyword-badge extinct">Extinct</span></h4>
      <p>Extinct is a death trigger - the effect activates when the creature dies. This can summon new creatures, deal damage, or trigger other powerful effects.</p>
      <p><em>Example: Ancient Egg (1 mana, 0/3 with Extinct: Summon a 3/3 Hatchling) - A defensive card that provides value when destroyed.</em></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Abilities</h2>

    <h3>Battlecry</h3>
    <p>Battlecry effects trigger immediately when you play a card from your hand. They do not trigger when a creature is summoned by another effect.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Targeted Battlecry:</strong> Some battlecries require you to choose a target (click on a creature or hero)</li>
      <li><strong>Automatic Battlecry:</strong> Others affect all targets automatically (like "deal 2 damage to all enemies")</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example: Megalodon (7 mana, 7/5) - Battlecry: Destroy an enemy creature. When played, you can remove any enemy creature from the board.</em></p>

    <h3>Triggered Abilities</h3>
    <p>Some creatures have abilities that trigger during specific game events:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>At the start of your turn:</strong> Triggers each time your turn begins</li>
      <li><strong>At the end of your turn:</strong> Triggers each time your turn ends</li>
      <li><strong>Whenever you draw a card:</strong> Triggers each time you draw</li>
      <li><strong>When this takes damage:</strong> Triggers when the creature is damaged</li>
      <li><strong>When you summon a creature:</strong> Triggers when any creature enters your board</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example: Oviraptor (2 mana, 2/2) - Whenever you draw a card, gain +1 Attack. Grows stronger with each card drawn.</em></p>

    <h2>Effect Types</h2>

    <p>Cards can have various effects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Deal damage to creatures or heroes</li>
      <li><strong>Heal:</strong> Restore health to creatures or your hero</li>
      <li><strong>Buff (+X/+Y):</strong> Increase a creature's Attack and/or Health</li>
      <li><strong>Debuff (-X/-Y):</strong> Decrease a creature's Attack (cannot go below 0)</li>
      <li><strong>Draw:</strong> Draw cards from your deck</li>
      <li><strong>Destroy:</strong> Instantly destroy a creature regardless of health</li>
      <li><strong>Summon:</strong> Create new creatures on your board</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <h4>Targeting Tip</h4>
      <p>When a card says "all enemies," it means all enemy creatures AND the enemy hero. "All enemy creatures" only affects creatures on the board. Pay attention to the exact wording!</p>
    </div>
